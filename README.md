# Garden-Monitoring-System
This is a garden monitoring system built using Arduino and a few sensors.
## What it is supposed to do
### This system will monitor the temperature of the area as well as protect the flowers from unwanted pests. 
### Based on the temperature, following activities should occur:-
* If temperature > 40C, turn LED red (Very hot)
* If temperature > 30C, turn LED yellow (Getting hot)
* If temperature <30, turn LED green (Comfortable)
### But if shadow is detected over the flowers then LED starts blinking red at 1 Hz.
### If a pest reaches within 20 cm from the flowers then the servo motor should rotate back & forth (180Â°) to scare the pest away.
